            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>A recent IT graduate with a solid background in technical support, networks, and software development. Passionate about solving technological problems and constantly learning. I graduated from Rosario de Naranjo Technical and Professional College, where I gained practical experience in networks, databases, and programming (Python, C#, HTML/CSS, JavaScript).
              During my internship, I developed skills in preventive and corrective equipment maintenance, software installation, basic network configuration, and customer service. I stand out for my responsibility, proactive attitude, and ability to quickly adapt to new work environments.
              Additionally, I have knowledge in API development with FastAPI and basic experience applying machine learning concepts.</p>
